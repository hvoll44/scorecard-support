        <p>Welcome to the support page for the <strong>ScoreCard</strong> app. Here, you will find information on how to use the app, troubleshoot issues, and get help.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How do I sync scores in real-time?</strong><br>
                Someone must create a new game and click the share icon. Once it displays a 6-digit code others can click Join Game from the main menu. Enter the code and enjoy. Scores will be updated in real-time for all participants.</li>
            <li><strong>Where is my data stored?</strong><br>
                Data is stored locally on your device and is not shared with any external services. Shared games are temporarily stored in the cloud to enable syncing scores with others. Games that are not shared only store data on your local device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <p>If you encounter any issues with the app, try the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure your app is up to date.</li>
            <li>Check your internet connection for syncing issues.</li>
            <li>If shared games are not syncing in real-time, try turning the screen off and on.</li>
            <li>Restart the app if it becomes unresponsive.</li>
        </ul>
